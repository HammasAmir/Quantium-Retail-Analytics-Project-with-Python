# Task 2: Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation

## Objective
Analyze trial vs control store performance to determine the success of trials, identify sales drivers, and provide recommendations for each store based on insights.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Select Control Stores
- Defined key metrics for control store selection (e.g., total sales, number of customers, product mix).
- Explored data to identify potential control stores that closely matched trial stores.
- Created visualizations to compare metrics and validate selection.
- Developed a function to automate control store identification.

### 2. Assessment of Trial Performance
- Analyzed each trial store against its selected control store.
- Compared metrics such as total sales, transaction counts, and average basket size during the trial period.
- Used visualizations (line charts, bar charts) to identify performance trends.
- Determined whether each trial storeâ€™s performance improvements were statistically significant.

### 3. Collate Findings & Recommendations
- Summarized insights for each store in a clear, concise format.
- Identified which trial stores showed positive performance uplift versus control stores.
- Recommended whether to roll out changes more widely based on trial outcomes.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
A clear evaluation of trial vs control store performance, supported by data visualizations and metrics, along with actionable recommendations for further business decisions.
